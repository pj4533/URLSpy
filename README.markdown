URLSpy
======

URLSpy is meant as a tool similar to 'tail -f'.  Rather than just watching access_logs, URLSpy parses them and creates clickable links out of any GET requests.

Useful for checking out mobile pages in desktop browsers without cutting/pasting.

Big thanks to [mdippery](https://github.com/mdippery mdippery) for his awesome [FileTailer](https://gist.github.com/777080 "FileTailer") gist.  I used it as the basis for URLSpy.
